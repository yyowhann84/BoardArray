IMPORTANT REMINDER: Do NOT edit whatever is in the `tests` folder. I will mark you automatic 0 if you do.

Instructions:

1. Implement `void add(Entry* entry)` in the boardarray.h.
    Algorithm (in order):
        a. Traverse the array up until the last element
        b. Compare (using the bool compare() function of Entry) the `entry` to be added to the `existing entry` currently traversed.
        c. To get the current entry, you can access it via `array[i * sizeof(Entry)]` or `*(array + i * sizeof(Entry)). I will discuss first why is this the case.
        d. If `entry` to be added is indeed greater than the existing one, `SHIFT RIGHT`
        e. After shift right, add the new entry to the correct position.

    Things to consider:
        - You can still add an entry EVEN IF the array is FULL for as long as the newly added array is greater than most scores in the current boardarray
        - IF ARRAY IS FULL and the SCORE IS TOO LOW TO BE ADDED TO BOARDARRAY, print "<name>'s score is too low to be added!".
        - You can test in the main() function and interact with it to test your code before running full unit test

2. Navigate to tests folder by running:
    ```
        cd src/tests
    ```

3. Run the unit test on the terminal via:
    ```
        g++ test.cpp catch.cpp -o test.exe && ./test.exe
    ```

4. If you are already finished, run the following terminal command in order:
    ```
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: implement add() method for boardarray"
        git push <remote-name>
    ```

    If you forgot the remote-name for your own forked repository, run the ff:
    ```
        git remote -v
    ```

    It should output something like
    ```
        origin   https://github.com/lancevincentsalera/BoardArray.git (fetch)
        origin   https://github.com/lancevincentsalera/BoardArray.git (push)
        <remote-name> https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git (fetch)
        <remote-name> https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git (push)
    ```

5. Pass the link to your github repo in the MS Teams assignment tab
